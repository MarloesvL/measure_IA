# Roadmap

From the README, the planned developments include:

- Full documentation website (this is the start)
- More exhaustive docstrings and internal method docs
- Lightcone methods & validation
- Multiprocessing support for lightcone version
- Additional optional features (e.g. responsivity factor, alternate definitions)

The issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarloesvL/measure_IA) are also used as To Do's.
Feel free to request features or comment on those already there to let me know you would like them to have a higher
priority.
