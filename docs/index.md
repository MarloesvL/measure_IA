# MeasureIA Documentation

Welcome to the fledgling documentation site of MeasureIA!
These docs will be updated in due time.
Please feel free to contact me (m.l.vanheukelum@uu.nl) if you have any questions or create an issue on GitHub.

## Pages
### Home
This is where you are now.
### Output
This page shows the file structure and auto-generated group and dataset names (given your input) of the output 
file that is generated by the MeasureIA package.
### API REFERENCE
These pages include the api reference of the most important docstrings.
Here, you can find the methods needed for the measurement of IA correlations and all the descriptions of all the 
input parameters needed to run them.
There are still methods and classes missing that will be added in the future.
